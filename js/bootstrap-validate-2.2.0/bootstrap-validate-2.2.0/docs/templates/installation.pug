      |    Package Managers

  p As stated above you can easily install #{meta.name} using your favourite package manager.
    |  However we do recommend installing with yarn.

  h3 yarn

  pre
    code.bash yarn add bootstrap-validate


  h3 npm

  pre
    code.bash npm i bootstrap-validate

      |    CDN


  p RawGit makes including #{meta.name} in your project super easy, providing a CDN allowing you to use a specific version of #{meta.name}.

  p For the current version, you can just include

  pre
    code.html
      | &lt;script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/PascaleBeier/bootstrap-validate/#{meta.version}/dist/bootstrap-validate.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


  h2 Download

  p You can grab the full Source Code including build files and documentation from our&nbsp;
    a(href="download.html") Download Archive.
    |.


  h2 Usage with Webpack etc.

  p #{meta.name} can be used in ES6+ Environments as well. However, importing the library has a small quirk.

  p You will need to

  pre
    code.javascript
      | import * as bootstrapValidate from 'bootstrap-validate';
      | window.bootstrapValidate = bootstrapValidate;

  p to export the bootstrapValidate function to your resulting bundle.
